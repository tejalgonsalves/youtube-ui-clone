# YouTube UI Clone ⏯️

A YouTube UI clone replicates the design and layout of YouTube's interface, featuring a header with a logo and search bar, a sidebar for navigation, and a main content area displaying video thumbnails and a video player. It aims to provide a similar user experience through responsive design and interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
